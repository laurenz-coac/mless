*Second homework assignment*
Based on the notebooks in the time_series_forecasting folder, perform the three following tasks:

1. Extend the code in notebook 7_multi_model_plotting to read the forecast results from all trained models and plot all curves in one panel. Make sure that your code can be re-used if you make forecasts for other stations or time episodes.
2. Extend at least one of the models to input multivariate data. Download ozone data from TOAR (use the scripts in notebook 1). Copy the notebook with the model of your choice into a new notebook and extend the code so that temperazure and ozone data are used as inputs. The goal is to forecast ozone concentrations, you don't need to output temperature.
3. In reality, you will often have forecasts of weather variables (here temperature) available, so you can use future temperature values to forecast the ozone concentrations. Make another copy of your multivariate notebook and adjust the code accordingly. Use your multi-model plotter to compare the results from tasks 2 and 3.
